# Purchase Prediction
A toy example of a repo to predict whether an online shopper will purchase an item generated by GPT3.5 Turbo with the following query:
``` Please create 3 files. The first file should look at an S3 bucket called "data", read in our"super_important_purchase_data.csv" where the 5 columns of the(age, location, page_name, time_on_page, purchased_boolean) , and do some basic cleaning on the large CSV. The second file one that does machine learning to use the data to predicted purchased_boolean. The last file should be a basic API in fastAPI style to host our model.```
